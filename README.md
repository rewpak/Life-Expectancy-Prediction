# Life-Expectancy-Prediction
Creating
a model to predict human life expectancy using social, environmental, and health dataset s .
•
Analyzing a comprehensive dataset containing 9928 observations and 22 variables from various countries and years.
•
Data preparation and cleaning to ensure optimal data quality for analysis.
•
Standardization and normaliz ation of variables, handl ing missing values, and identif ying outliers.
•
Implementation of univariate and multivariate analyses to identify patterns and correlations.
•
Appl y i ng the principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering methods to understand data
structure and reduce dimensionality.
•
I mplement ing a Random Forest algorithm to predict life expectancy. Tun ing hyperparameters to
optimize model performance. Evaluated model using metrics such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R².
•
Develop ing a deep neural network (DNN) model to capture complex nonlinear patterns in the
data. Experiment with various configurations of hidden layers, neurons, learning rates, and batch
sizes Emp loying early stopping to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.
•
Compar ison of machine learning (Random Forest) and deep learning (DNN) models.
